Vehicle Simulation
This project is a vehicle simulation application that simulates vehicles moving in different scenarios. It allows users to observe and interact with various vehicles moving in different directions, including left, right, up, and down.

Features
Vehicle movement: The application simulates vehicles moving in different directions.
Multiple scenarios: There are different scenarios available to observe the vehicles' movement in various environments.
User interaction: Users can interact with the simulation by controlling the vehicles or adjusting the simulation settings.

Getting Started
To run the vehicle simulation application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/manojsinghkoranga/apextechnologies-assignment.
Navigate to the project directory: cd apextechnologies-assignment.
Install the dependencies: npm install.

To start the development server for both the React app and JSON Server, run the following command: "npm start"
This command will start the React development server at http://localhost:3000 and the JSON Server at http://localhost:3030. The React app will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source code.

JSON Server
The JSON Server is used to save data for the vehicle simulation. It provides a RESTful API to perform CRUD operations on the data. The data is stored in a db.json file located in the root directory.
